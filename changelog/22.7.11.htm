<p>Hello there,</p><p>This will be the end of life release for the 22.7 series with only a small number of reliability updates.  Upgrades to 23.1-RC1 are possible from the development version of this release.  We do expect an online update for RC2 next week.</p><p>The final 23.1 release will be on January 26.  As always the upgrade path from the community version will be added as a hotfix shortly after the final release announcement is published.  However, this time around LibreSSL will no longer update and must be switched to the OpenSSL flavour prior to the upgrade.</p><p>Here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>system: fix a few minor Coverity Scan reports in Python code[<a target="_blank" href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/opnsense-core">1</a>]</li><li>firewall: show automated "port 0" rule as actual port "0" on PHP 8</li><li>reporting: fix incompatible regex syntax in FreeBSD 13.1 for firewall state health statistics</li><li>unbound: safeguard retrieval of blocklist shortcode</li><li>mvc: fix IntegerField minimum value (contributed by xbb)</li><li>plugins: os-acme-client 3.15[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/22.7/security/acme-client/pkg-descr">2</a>]</li><li>plugins: os-stunnel fixes missing include in certificate script</li><li>ports: curl 7.87.0[<a target="_blank" href="https://curl.se/changes.html#7_87_0">3</a>]</li><li>ports: nss 3.87[<a target="_blank" href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/releases/nss_3_87.html">4</a>]</li><li>ports: pcre 10.42[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcre.org/changelog.txt">5</a>]</li><li>ports: phalcon 5.1.4[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/releases/tag/v5.1.4">6</a>]</li><li>ports: php 8.0.27[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.0.27">7</a>]</li><li>ports: sqlite 3.40.1[<a target="_blank" href="https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_40_1.html">8</a>]</li><li>ports: strongswan 5.9.9[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/releases/tag/5.9.9">9</a>]</li><li>ports: unbound 1.17.1[<a target="_blank" href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/download/#unbound-1-17-1">10</a>]</li></ul></p><p>A hotfix release was issued as 22.7.11_1:</p><p><ul><li>firmware: enable upgrade path to 23.1 (OpenSSL only)</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
