<p>A good day to you all,</p><p>As the end of the year inches closer the changes published today are naturally smaller additions and cleanups, notably changes for IPsec VTI connection for IPv6 and dual-stack operation, a possible OpenVPN CSO mismatch bug and optional support for SHA-512 password hashing.</p><p>Note that the HTTPS bump for the firmware mirrors updates the published URLs in the firmware selection, but if you already use LeaseWeb or NYC BUG you need to reselect them in order to move from HTTP to HTTPS connectivity.</p><p>Of further note is that the Squid web proxy will be moved to a plugin in version 24.1 but for everyone using it the upgrade procedure will make sure to install it automatically when enabled.  A meta package was added to the plugins already in order for this to work just in case there are questions about what it is supposed to be doing... apart from providing dependencies it does not do anything at the moment.  ;)</p><p>Last but not least, we have been successfully testing and ironing out OpenSSL 3 ports builds in the past week and inclusion in 24.1 seems very likely at this point.  The effort continues and we will also be looking into backport material from FreeBSD 13 stable branches for further preparation.</p><p>Here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>system: add SHA-512 password hash compliance option</li><li>system: allow special selector for plugins_configure()</li><li>system: handle broken menu XML files more gracefully</li><li>system: fix PHP warnings and SSH fail on empty "ssh" XML node</li><li>system: fix a couple of PHP warnings in auth server pages</li><li>system: add support for Google Shared drives backup (contributed by Jeremy Huylebroeck)</li><li>system: change wait time to 1 second per round, total of 7 in console prompts</li><li>system: update syslog model</li><li>interfaces: mark WireGuard devices as virtual</li><li>interfaces: update LAGG and loopback models</li><li>interfaces: improve VIP validation, fix broadcast generation</li><li>firewall: make sure firewall log reading always emits a label</li><li>firewall: fix business bogons set fetch</li><li>firewall: add section for automatic rules being added at the end of the ruleset</li><li>firewall: allow multiple networks given to wrap in the GUI</li><li>captive portal: fix log target</li><li>firmware: stop manually adjusting firmware config structure during factory reset</li><li>firmware: clear stray "pkgsave" and "pkgtemp" pkg-upgrade leftovers</li><li>firmware: changed LeaseWeb and NYC BUG mirrors to use HTTPS (contributed by jeremiah-rs)</li><li>firmware: opnsense-update: new "-X" mode for canonical bogons/changelog set fetch URL</li><li>firmware: opnsense-version: support base/kernel hash info</li><li>ipsec: mute ipsec.conf related load errors</li><li>ipsec: fix typo in VTI protocol family parsing</li><li>ipsec: add secondary tunnel address pair for VTI dual-stack purposes</li><li>ipsec: add "aes256-sha256" proposal option (no PFS)</li><li>openvpn: obey username_as_common_name setting</li><li>backend: add physical_interface and physical_interfaces as template helper function</li><li>backend: add file_exists as template helper function</li><li>mvc: instead of failing invalidate a non-match in CSVListField</li><li>mvc: split tree-view template and javascript and hook via controllers</li><li>ui: upgrade bootstrap-select to v1.13.18</li><li>ui: improve saveFormToEndpoint() UX</li><li>plugins: os-ddclient 1.17[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/23.7/dns/ddclient/pkg-descr">1</a>]</li><li>plugins: os-frr 1.37[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/23.7/net/frr/pkg-descr">2</a>]</li><li>plugins: os-squid adds a meta package for web proxy core removal in 24.1</li><li>ports: openvpn 2.6.8[<a target="_blank" href="https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/ChangesInOpenvpn26#Changesin2.6.8">3</a>]</li><li>ports: sqlite 3.44.0[<a target="_blank" href="https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_44_0.html">4</a>]</li><li>ports: sudo 1.9.15p2[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sudo.ws/stable.html#1.9.15p2">5</a>]</li><li>ports: unbound 1.19.0[<a target="_blank" href="https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/download/#unbound-1-19-0">6</a>]</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
