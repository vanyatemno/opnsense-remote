<p>Hey,</p><p>A small update to improve stability with multiple delegated prefixes from DHCPv6 connectivity as well as proper "no binding" handling in the DHCPv6 client itself.  Internally, the backend service has been refactored to allow for future additions, but no visible functionality changes have been done.</p><p>Still pretty happy with the IPsec connections MVC pages introduced in 23.1 so we would like to apply the same approach to OpenVPN for 23.7 and it is going to land in the next development version most likely for a sneak preview.</p><p>Here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>system: fix MVC service page with ID-based reload like OpenVPN</li><li>system: fix issue with route add command for far gateway static route (contributed by Daniel Mason)</li><li>system: improve static routes error handling</li><li>system: fix a typo and align "attribute" use in gateway edit page</li><li>system: pluginctl: service mode can now batch-reload services when existing ID is omitted</li><li>firewall: simplify rule edit layout slightly and fix unused element ID</li><li>dhcp: remove ::/64 magic as it uses AdvRouterAddr yes</li><li>interfaces: deal with RENEW and REBIND only reporting partial PDINFO</li><li>ipsec: support the default selector ([dynamic]) when local_ts or remote_ts are left empty in connections</li><li>backend: improved nested command support, reorganise action types, use ActionFactory to offer the requested type</li><li>backend: add "getUtcTime" template helper function</li><li>ports: curl 8.1.1[<a target="_blank" href="https://curl.se/changes.html#8_1_1">1</a>]</li><li>ports: dhcp6c 20230530</li><li>ports: lighttpd 1.4.71[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lighttpd.net/2023/5/27/1.4.71/">2</a>]</li><li>ports: openssh 9.3p1[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-9.3">3</a>]</li><li>ports: sqlite 3.42.0[<a target="_blank" href="https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_42_0.html">4</a>]</li><li>ports: syslog-ng 4.2.0[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/releases/tag/syslog-ng-4.2.0">5</a>]</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay Safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
