<p>Hello,</p><p>Apart from security updates for operating system and third party software this mainly fixes issues with the initial 23.1 release.  IPsec and Unbound components in particular receive a number of improvements being the more prominent areas of work for this series.  Unbound also gained a SafeSearch option and the new reporting database CPU usage should be much lower and easier to use.</p><p>Overall we are happy with how the major release turned out and look forward to further fixes in e.g. Netmap framework including Suricata changes for multi-threading support which has been in the works for a long time.  OpenVPN 2.6 update and related changes are also pending at the moment.</p><p>The roadmap for 23.7 will be published soon and will again include a number of MVC/API conversions for static components.  Statistics do indicate that we are over 60% done with converting the code base to a modern framework as compared to early 2015 which is now already over 8 years ago!</p><p>Here are the full patch

release was issued as 23.1.1_2:</p><p><ul><li>captive portal: remove mod_evasion use which was discontinued by lighttpd</li><li>unbound: wait for pipe in logger (contributed by kulikov-a)</li></ul></p><p>Rate limiting was removed from the captive portal which was set to 250 connections by the same IP to the captive portal itself.  This can be easily replaced by a manual firewall rule with advanced options set, e.g. "Max established" set to 250 with destination "This Firewall".</p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
