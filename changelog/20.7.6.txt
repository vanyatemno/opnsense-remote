Dear all,

This update brings the usual mix of reliability fixes, plugin and third party
software updates: FreeBSD, HardenedBSD, PHP, OpenSSH, StrongSwan, Suricata and
Syslog-ng amongst others.

Please note that Let's Encrypt users need to reissue their certificates
manually after upgrading to this version to fix the embedded certificate chain
issue with the current signing CA switch going on.

The mail backup plugin is currently not available pending a response from
the maintainer.  Users are advised to avoid using it for the moment.
